    ## Terminology

    | Term    | Explanation                                                                                        |
    | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | dApp    | A (web3) application which needs access to the Qubic Wallet                                        |
    | session | A connection between a dApp and the Qubic Wallet                                                   |
    | method  | Functionality that is exposed by the Qubic Wallet and can be invoked by the dApp                   |
    | event   | Information that can be pushed from the Qubic Wallet to a dApp without the later making any action |

    ## Session Establishment

    A dApp initializes a connection to the WC servers and generates a connection URL. 
    The URL contains information about the dApp and the required _methods_ and _events_ that are going to be used in the connection. 
    The URL is passed to the wallet (via QR code scanning or copy-paste). 
    The wallet prompts the user to accept or reject the connection.

    If rejected, the dApp receives the following response: 
    `{code: 5000, message: 'User rejected.'}`

    If accepted, the dApp receives a
    `SessionConnect` event. This event contains various information, most importantly the _expiration time_(when the session dies) and _topic_(which is an ID)
    Once accepted, the connection is established as a session. The session can be active for a few hours to a few days.

    ## Custom Links
    The application registers `qubic-wallet://` custom scheme. 
    To initialize a wallet connect session please link to
    `qubic-wallet://pairwc/wc:....`
