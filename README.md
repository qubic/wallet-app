## Cryptographic operations

### Mobile version

Open source Dart cryptographic libraries for required algorithms state that are not audited / production ready. For this, we are using an embedded web browser
which features the Web Crypto API and use Javascript libs for the cryptographic operations. This is transparent to the end user. Javascript libs are extracted by qubic.li wallet and added as an asset.

### Desktop version

In order to not have to embed a javascript runtime inside the application, for desktop apps, we have compiled the Javascript libs to standalone executables using pkg. You can find them here: https://github.com/qubic/ts-library-wrapper
Desktop versions try to locate the appropriate executable and if it's missing it automatically downloads it (or allows the user to manually download it).

### Anti-tampering

Both mobile and desktop version check the Hashes of the assets / executables before using them, in order to prevent tampering.

## Backend

Your keys are never shared to any 3rd party. Yet the wallet uses some backend services:

### Access to Qubic Network

Access to the Qubic Network is currently provided by the wonderful work of (https://www.qubic.org). We are working with a new version to interface directly with the Computor nodes.
